Step 3: Insert Student Records
Now, let’s insert two student records.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Insert the First Student
javascript
db.students.insertOne({
    rollNumber: "RN1001",
    firstName: "Alice",
    middleName: "M.",
    lastName: "Smith",

});

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Step 4: Verify the Records
You can check that the records have been inserted successfully by retrieving all student records.
Retrieve All Students
javascript
db.students.find().pretty();

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Summary of Commands
Here’s a concise summary of the commands to insert two student records:

Switch to college database:
javascript
use college
Insert the First Student:
javascript
db.students.insertOne({...});
Insert the Second Student:

Sure! Let's perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on the two student records we just inserted. 
Here’s a step-by-step guide for each operation.
Step 1: Open the MongoDB Shell
Make sure to start the MongoDB shell:
bash
mongosh
or
bash
mongo
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Step 2: Switch to the college Database
Ensure you are in the correct database:
javascript
use college
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Create (Insert a New Student Record)
Since we already inserted two students, let's show how to create another student record.
Insert a New Student
javascript

db.students.insertOne({
    rollNumber: "RN1003",
    firstName: "Charlie",
    middleName: "P.",
    lastName: "Brown",
    email: "charlie.brown@college.com",
    phoneNumber: "234-567-8901",
    address: "789 Maple St, Springfield",
    class: "Class 12",
    gender: "Male",
    age: 18
});
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Read (Retrieve Student Records)
Now let’s read all the student records to see the current list.
Retrieve All Students
javascript
db.students.find().pretty();
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Retrieve a Specific Student
To get details of a specific student (e.g., Bob Johnson):
javascript
db.students.find({ rollNumber: "RN1002" }).pretty();
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Delete (Remove a Student Record)

Now, let’s delete one of the student records, for instance, Charlie Brown.
Delete Charlie’s Record

javascript

db.students.deleteOne({ rollNumber: "RN1003" });
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Read Again (Verify the Deletion)

Finally, let’s confirm that Charlie’s record has been removed by retrieving all students again.
Retrieve All Students

javascript

db.students.find().pretty();
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Summary of CRUD Operations on the Two Student Records

    Create (Insert):
        Add a new student record (e.g., Charlie Brown).

    javascript

db.students.insertOne({...});

Read (Retrieve):

    Retrieve all student records.

javascript

db.students.find().pretty();

    Retrieve a specific student (e.g., Bob Johnson).

javascript

db.students.find({ rollNumber: "RN1002" }).pretty();

Update:

    Update a specific student's email (e.g., Bob Johnson).

javascript

db.students.updateOne({ rollNumber: "RN1002" }, { $set: { email: "bob.updated@college.com" } });

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Read Again:

    Verify the update for a specific student.

javascript

db.students.find({ rollNumber: "RN1002" }).pretty();

Delete:

    Remove a student record (e.g., Charlie Brown).

javascript

db.students.deleteOne({ rollNumber: "RN1003" });

Read Final State:

    Confirm the deletion by retrieving all students.

javascript

    db.students.find().pretty();

This process gives your students a clear understanding of how to perform CRUD operations on the student records. Let me know if you need further clarification or assistance!
