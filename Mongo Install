Install MongoDB Community Edition on Ubuntu
Overview

Use this tutorial to install MongoDB 8.0 Community Edition on LTS (long-term support) releases of Ubuntu Linux using the apt package manager.
MongoDB Version

This tutorial installs MongoDB 8.0 Community Edition. To install a different version of MongoDB Community, use the version drop-down menu in the upper-left corner of this page to select the documentation for that version.
Considerations
Platform Support

MongoDB 8.0 Community Edition supports the following 64-bit Ubuntu LTS (long-term support) releases on x86_64 architecture:

    24.04 LTS ("Noble")

    22.04 LTS ("Jammy")

    20.04 LTS ("Focal")

MongoDB only supports the 64-bit versions of these platforms. To determine which Ubuntu release your host is running, run the following command on the host's terminal:

cat /etc/lsb-release




Install MongoDB Community Edition

Follow these steps to install MongoDB Community Edition using the apt package manager.
1
Import the Public Key

From a terminal, install gnupg and curl if they are not already available:

sudo apt-get install gnupg curl



To import the MongoDB public GPG key, run the following command:

curl -fsSL https://www.mongodb.org/static/pgp/server-8.0.asc | \
   sudo gpg -o /usr/share/keyrings/mongodb-server-8.0.gpg \
   --dearmor




Create the List File

Create the list file /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mongodb-org-8.0.list for your version of Ubuntu.



Create the list file for Ubuntu 22.04 (Jammy):


echo "deb [ arch=amd64,arm64 signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/mongodb-server-8.0.gpg ] https://repo.mongodb.org/apt/ubuntu jammy/mongodb-org/8.0 multiverse" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mongodb-org-8.0.list


Reload the Package Database

Issue the following command to reload the local package database:

sudo apt-get update



Install MongoDB Community Server

You can install either the latest stable version of MongoDB or a specific version of MongoDB.



To install the latest stable version, issue the following

sudo apt-get install -y mongodb-org

If the ulimit value for number of open files is under 64000, MongoDB generates a startup warning.
Directories

If you installed through the package manager, the data directory /var/lib/mongodb and the log directory /var/log/mongodb are created during the installation.


Start MongoDB.

You can start the mongod process by issuing the following command:

sudo systemctl start mongod



Run the following command first:

sudo systemctl daemon-reload


Verify that MongoDB has started successfully.

sudo systemctl status mongod



You can optionally ensure that MongoDB will start following a system reboot by issuing the following command:

sudo systemctl enable mongod


Stop MongoDB.

As needed, you can stop the mongod process by issuing the following command:

sudo systemctl stop mongod

Restart MongoDB.

You can restart the mongod process by issuing the following command:

sudo systemctl restart mongod

You can follow the state of the process for errors or important messages by watching the output in the /var/log/mongodb/mongod.log file.


Begin using MongoDB.

Start a mongosh session on the same host machine as the mongod. You can run mongosh without any command-line options to connect to a mongod that is running on your localhost with default port 27017.
